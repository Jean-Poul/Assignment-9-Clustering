#### The objective:
Practicing unsupervised machine learning: clustering.  
The tasks:  
1. In Exercise 1 we used Hierarchical clustering algorithm.  
• Which type?  
• How many types of hierarchical clustering are you familiar with?  
• How do they differ?  
2. Train a clustering model with Mean Shift algorithm and freedom.csv data source
file.  
• store your model in a file  
• create simple web application that can deploy and run the model as seen in class  
• run the application for predicting the cluster of a data set  
• take and attach a screen shot of your solution  
3. Describe the difference between K-means and Mean Shift algorithms  
• in which occasions would you prefer to use the mean shift algorithm?
